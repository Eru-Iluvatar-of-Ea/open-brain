# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

All Supabase commands run from `Open-Brain/Supabase/`:

```bash
# Local stack
supabase start
supabase stop

# Develop function locally (hot reload, per_worker policy)
supabase functions serve open-brain-mcp

# Type-check / lint (run from Supabase/functions/open-brain-mcp/ — running from a
# parent dir misses the deno.json import map and produces false "not a dependency" errors)
deno check index.ts
deno lint index.ts

# Deploy to production
supabase functions deploy open-brain-mcp
```

Local secrets live in `Supabase/.env.local` (not committed). The VS Code Deno extension is scoped to `Supabase/functions/`.

## Workflow rules

- Commit (and push) before `supabase functions deploy` — git should always match what is in production. A global PreToolUse hook asks for confirmation if the tree is dirty at deploy time.
- When changing tool behavior (defaults, limits, output shape), change it in the edge function, not per-client — one server-side fix applies to Claude Desktop, claude.ai, and Claude Code at once.
- If deploy output reports a newer Supabase CLI version, run `brew upgrade supabase` when convenient.

## Architecture

Single Supabase Edge Function (`Supabase/functions/open-brain-mcp/index.ts`) that serves an MCP server over HTTP.

**Request flow:**
1. Hono app handles all routes — CORS preflight at `OPTIONS *`, everything else at `ALL *`
2. Auth: `x-brain-key` header or `?key=` query param checked against `MCP_ACCESS_KEY` env var
3. Claude Desktop workaround: missing `Accept: text/event-stream` header is patched onto the request before handing off to `StreamableHTTPTransport`
4. `@hono/mcp` `StreamableHTTPTransport` bridges Hono's request/response to the MCP SDK

**MCP tools registered:**
- `search` / `fetch` — read-only ChatGPT compatibility tools (search/fetch naming convention)
- `search_thoughts` — semantic search via `match_thoughts` Postgres RPC (pgvector)
- `list_thoughts` — recent thoughts with filters (type, topic, person, days)
- `thought_stats` — aggregate counts by type/topic/people
- `capture_thought` — write path: calls OpenRouter for embedding + metadata extraction in parallel, then `upsert_thought` RPC, then updates the embedding column

**External dependencies:**
- `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — direct DB access via service role (bypasses RLS)
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — embeddings via `openai/text-embedding-3-small`, metadata via `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
- `MCP_ACCESS_KEY` — custom auth key for all requests
- `OPEN_BRAIN_CITATION_BASE_URL` — optional base URL for thought citation links (defaults to `https://openbrain.local/thoughts`)

**Database schema (inferred from RPC calls):**
- `thoughts` table: `id`, `content`, `metadata` (JSONB), `embedding` (vector), `created_at`, `updated_at`
- `metadata` JSONB keys (written by `extractMetadata`): `type`, `topics[]`, `people[]`, `action_items[]`, `dates_mentioned[]`, plus `source` (set to `"mcp"` on capture). `type` is a fixed enum: `observation | task | idea | reference | person_note` — `list_thoughts` type/topic/person filters rely on this vocabulary via Postgres JSONB `contains` (array membership), so values must match exactly.
- `match_thoughts(query_embedding, match_threshold, match_count, filter)` — pgvector similarity search RPC
- `upsert_thought(p_content, p_payload)` — dedup + insert RPC, returns `{ id }`

**Import map:** `deno.json` pins all npm deps. No lock file — versions are fixed in `deno.json` directly.

**Auth — single layer (`x-brain-key`):** JWT verification is intentionally **off** (`verify_jwt = false` in `config.toml`, `[functions.open-brain-mcp]`). MCP clients (Claude Desktop / claude.ai) can't send a Supabase JWT; with verification on, the gateway 401s before the function runs and Claude misreads the challenge as an OAuth requirement. So the function is the *only* auth gate: it checks `x-brain-key` header or `?key=` query param against `MCP_ACCESS_KEY` (index.ts:525). Do not flip `verify_jwt` back on without a JWT-capable client.

**`capture_thought` write path detail:** embedding (`text-embedding-3-small`) and metadata (`gpt-4o-mini`, JSON mode) are fetched in parallel via `Promise.all`, then `upsert_thought` RPC runs with `source: "mcp"` merged into metadata, and finally a separate `supabase.from("thoughts").update({ embedding })` call writes the vector. Two round-trips are required because the RPC doesn't accept the embedding column directly. If metadata JSON parsing fails, it falls back to `{ topics: ["uncategorized"], type: "observation" }` rather than erroring.

**Claude Desktop header workaround:** `StreamableHTTPTransport` requires `Accept: text/event-stream`. Claude Desktop connectors omit it, so the Hono handler reconstructs the raw `Request` with the header patched in before handing off to the transport (see the `duplex: "half"` comment at index.ts:540).

## `_guide/` knowledge base

`_guide/` is a prose knowledge base about Open Brain (design rationale, capture strategy, memory model) — not code, and unrelated to the edge function runtime. It uses a checkpoint→compile authoring workflow:

- `_guide/_toc.md` defines the canonical chapter slugs and a one-sentence scope per chapter.
- `_guide/_staging/` holds dated `checkpoint` notes with frontmatter (`chapters: [slug (new)]`, `tags`, `summary`). Processed ones move to `_staging/processed/`.
- Compiling merges checkpoints into the chapter files (`memory-architecture.md`, `pipeline-mechanics.md`, `capture-strategy.md`, `extending-the-system.md`) by their `chapters` tag. A checkpoint only proposes a new slug when no existing scope sentence covers it.

When editing guide content, respect the TOC slugs and tag checkpoints against them rather than creating ad-hoc files.
